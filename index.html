               <img id="titleDiv" src="images/div.png">
               <p><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b></p>
               <br>
               <p>My interest in IT would is based around creation. I very much like creating things through the use of programming languages. Whether it be websites, little applications, or even stuff like shortcuts on iOS. My interests in IT sparked from when I was apart of my year 7 IT class in High School. My teacher showed us a whole range of things from website design, terminal commands, through to photoshop. All this instilled the love for IT in me. My experience in IT currently would be working in a job that is centred around providing support for Apple devices and performing physical hardware repairs on them. I have also completed one year of studies previously in an IT degree.</p>
               <br>
               <p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></p>
               <br>
               <p>After moving to Melbourne and getting to know people who are currently studying at University, many people have raving reviews about attending RMIT for their higher education. When I concluded, I wanted to study online, and I discovered RMIT had courses on offer, I knew that’s the University I wanted to attend.</p>
               <br>
               <p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
               <br>
               <p>I expect to learn the fundamentals and develop the skills necessary to get me on the right foot with my career. However, just like everything in life, I can't be 100% sure what I will learn within this degree. IT is a passion of my mine, so I know whatever I do learn will be highly resourceful and have a large pay off in the future.</p>

               <p><b>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</b></p>
               <br>
               <p>I believe the role of Frontend Developer at Brolly would see me undertake the many tasks of creating and maintaining their website and products that they offer to their clients. Understanding the skills that are required for this role, I can only imagine that I would be on the front line of developing their web application and helping grow and evolve their services. This role is appealing to me because of the amount of exposure you can get to all different skills.</p>
               <br>
               <p><b>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</b></p>
               <br>
               <p>This role of Frontend Developer at Brolly requires the successful candidate to have many skills up their sleeve. Almost all the skills listed in the opening position are focused around web development and skills regarding the use of collaboration systems.</p>
               <br>
               <p><b>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</b></p>
               <br>
               <p>There are some listed skills advertised in the role of Frontend Developer at Brolly that I have previously acquired. I have done freelance web development and produced small projects for various entertainment companies. Within this work, I was able to develop the skills of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. The power of communication and teamwork, I have been able to produce at multiple roles I have previously held. My time at Apple has allowed me to focus on those set of skills and excel at them.</p>
               <br>
               <p><b>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</b></p>
               <br>
               <p>To acquire the skills to make me a strong candidate to be considered for the role, I would need to develop a handful of different skills, and start to build upon my already acquired skills. Completing my degree in Information Technology at RMIT will be a good starting point to get myself in the right direction. What I find very interesting about the required skills for this role is that a lot of the skills needed can easily be learnt through different education platforms online. There are many services to help polish your knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, ES6. Acquiring the needed skills can also be achieved for me by taking on more significant freelance roles with greater responsibility.</p>

               <p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b></p>
               <br>
               <p>It is surprising to see these results and find the connection between myself and what has been positioned. For example, the results from the learning style test show that I am a visual learner which I do agree. However, on the Big Five Personality test, I scored the highest on Neuroticism, and I don’t believe I show a majority of negative emotions. Ultimately, it is fantastic to discover all this information about myself that I didn’t quite understand before.</p>

               <p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b></p>
               <p>In a team environment, I do believe that having the trait of a visual learner could potentially be a disadvantage due to not having full control over how to outline my process of work. However, the sections I am tasked to do in a group environment, I should be able to adapt the work into a way that best fits my abilities. Looking at the Myers-Briggs results, my results in observing will hopefully allow me to understand where my team want to succeed and flourish.</p>
               <br>
               <p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></p>
               <br>
               <p>I should take into account that in my Myers-Briggs result, I scored high in being an introvert and being observant. I should step out of my comfort zone and speak up more than I would usually to allow myself to have a substantial and equal contribution to the teamwork. I believe I should also take that I am a visual learner into the fact and develop a way that would allow me to visualise the work in a way to help me succeed.</p>

               <p>
                  My idea for the Introduction to Information Technology group assignment is, the creation of a surveillance system focused around the use of Raspberry Pi and the addition of various attachment modules. The surveillance system I am proposing will allow Raspberry Pi and the attachment of a microphone module to listen for sounds related to crimes. These crimes can include burglaries through the breaking of windows, or even crimes related to the use of guns. By focusing this system around Raspberry Pi, we have the ability and freedom of being able to develop and fine-tune a system perfect for our individual needs. Raspberry Pi allows us to tap into a community of passionate programmers, hardware builders, and an extensive network of available attachment modules suited for us at relatively low costs.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  During my life, I have found myself coming home after a long day at work to discover my window smashed, and my things missing. To add to my luck, I have also woken up in the morning to see my car windows broken as well. Now, most people would believe that it would be uncommon for their private property or vehicles to be burgled, but take it from me. It can happen, a lot - multiple times. Due to this happening to myself, I have done extensive research on how to better protect myself and my belongings. However, I ultimately come to the same conclusions. Installing a home security system by well-known brands who specialise in home surveillance would most likely help my issues. However, These systems can incur a substantial upfront cost to purchase the equipment and install the system, and they can also including reoccurring costs.  I also have to consider one noteworthy aspect. I don't own my house. As a renter, my landlords previously have turned down my request to install a home security system, and ultimately I don't blame them. It is cheaper to fix a broken window, then deal with the costs and hassles of a mainstream surveillance system. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  By introducing Raspberry Pi into this situation, we are greeted with a building block to allow ourselves to be as creative as we want. Raspberry Pi is also a perfect solution to help resolve the problem of the cost of the surveillance system and applying the system into a rental property. As previously mentioned, the system would have a microphone attached to the Raspberry Pi, listening for the sound of a window breaking. These two components create a straightforward product, and most likely would not provide the best outcome for me. How would I know when the Raspberry Pi has been triggered? Because we have chosen a Raspberry Pi, we have many different options to improve upon this product, such as adding other modules. The best thing to add to this would most likely be a speaker to play some variant of an alarm when triggered. This alarm would be used to spook the assailant and to leave my property hopefully. However, I want to make a more advanced system. Because ultimately, I don't want to come home to an alarm going off to only discover my home broken into once more. I want to know in real-time. To do this, we have a whole range of options available. We can add a camera connected to the system to allow for real-time viewing of what is occurring. Or we can even develop a simple system to enable us to control the Raspberry Pi remotely to switch off the alarm or de trigger the system.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Like mentioned, the technology used in this surveillance system can range from as simple a few components to introducing multiple modules to compete with an expensive mainstream home surveillance system. Ultimately, whichever direction one would take with developing this system, there are similarities between both paths. Using a Raspberry Pi as the base system would require a PC, Mac, or Linux machine to allow for the user to interface with the device. This computer will be used to either develop the Raspberry Pi further or to maintain their product. The surveillance system would also need to know when to activate. This activation can occur in different ways. However, we will focus on the simplest way to allow for this system to trigger. Our Raspberry Pi can be programmed to take in the audio from the microphone and look for the sudden pitch in noise, commonly found when a window is broken in a quiet environment. This method would most likely be the most straightforward and most effective approach. As it is rare for homes that are inhabited to spontaneity omit a high pitch sound.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The skills for this surveillance system would range depending on what sort of functionalities you would like to apply to the product. However, ultimately, one would need a basic understanding of electronics as they would be tinkering with exposed components. Due to this, they would need an understanding of basic principles to Electrostatic Discharge as to not damage the Raspberry Pi and the attached modules. One would also need a sound knowledge of programming to allow their system even to work. The Raspberry Pi can allow for a wide range of different languages as a community of enthusiastic users have successfully ported common programming languages to be used and to control the Raspberry Pi. This catalogue can range from simple and easy to learn programming languages such as Scratch, Javascript, and even HTML to complex languages such as C++ or Erlang. However, it is recommended to understand Python as it is the official programming language for Raspberry Pi. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  If the development of a Raspberry Pi home surveillance system is successful, it will allow for the creation of a truly versatile product suited for different environments and uses. With the use of Raspberry Pi, it allows for true freedom not bound by mainstream surveillance companies or the limitations of rental properties and their landlords. It also allows for constant evolution, and the support and knowledge of an active community focused on advancing the possibilities of Raspberry Pi.
